        Generative AI such as Copilot and ChatGPT are all tools that we are quite familiar with, 
        this is especially true for computer science students as they are revolutionising the process 
        of coding in software development. In this article I will be discussing how AI systems assist 
        developers by providing code snippets, providing solutions for bugs, helping with repetitive tasks 
        therefore reducing the development time. I will also be looking at the potential challenges like,
        over reliance on AI and ethical considerations. This article will be based on recent studies that 
        are conducted in an educational setting, and investigates where AI has been used to support learning 
        and how it has been used.
